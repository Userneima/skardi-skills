"""Render a skardi-server workspace for searchable context. Two backends.

  --backend sqlite (default)
      This skill creates and owns <workspace>/kb.db: a `documents` table
      plus FTS5 and sqlite-vec `vec0` mirrors kept in sync by triggers.
      The user supplies nothing about storage. Writing DDL here is fine —
      the file is a workspace artifact, and deleting the workspace undoes
      it completely.

  --backend postgres
      Targets a table the USER created in a database the user runs. This
      script never runs DDL there. If the schema is missing, the caller
      prints the SQL and stops.

Flow:
  1. Resolve the embedding UDF + model path / remote args from flags.
  2. Render <workspace>/{ctx.yaml, semantics.yaml, pipelines/*.yaml} from
     ../assets/<backend>/ templates. Embedding happens server-side inside
     the rendered pipelines (chunk → embed → write in one INSERT for
     ingest-chunked; embed inline for search-{vector,hybrid}), so this
     needs the skardi-server-rag image or a server built --features rag.
  3. On sqlite only: create the .db and its schema.

This script never invokes the `skardi` CLI. Two reasons, both structural:

  * There is deliberately NO connectivity pre-flight. The CLI holds no
    engine since skardi PR #170, so it cannot reach a datastore before a
    server runs. Server startup is the check — see the note further down.
  * An earlier version gated setup on `skardi --version`, using the CLI
    version as a stand-in for the server's. That proxy does not hold: the
    v0.5.0 CLI is a thin HTTP client that talks to whatever server it is
    pointed at, so its version says nothing about the server that will
    actually run the pipelines — and requiring it on PATH blocked anyone
    running the server from the published container image. The real check
    is the server refusing to load a pipeline whose UDF it lacks.

Output: <workspace>/{ctx.yaml, semantics.yaml, pipelines/*.yaml}, the
sqlite .db when applicable, plus a `.embedding.txt` breadcrumb so
ingest_corpus.py / start_server.py know what the pipelines target without
re-parsing the YAML.

# Connectivity is now checked by starting the server: skardi-server loads

# that. Do not reintroduce a CLI-side probe here.
