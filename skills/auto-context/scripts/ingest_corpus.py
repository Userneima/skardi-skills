"""Walk a corpus directory and ingest every file into skardi-server.

Replaces the old chunk_corpus.py + embed.py + http_ingest.py trio. With
Skardi 0.4.0's chunk() UDF and the skardi-server-rag image (which bundles
chunk + embedding), the server now does both chunking and embedding inline
inside one INSERT — there is no client-side chunker, and no client-side
embedding step. We just:

  1. Walk the corpus, strip front-matter, build a per-file work list of
     {doc_id, source, content}.
  2. For each file, POST to /ingest-chunked/execute with chunk_size +
     overlap. The server runs ONE INSERT that UNNEST(chunk('markdown',
     content, ...)) → embed → write per chunk.

The unit of work is a file (not a chunk), so the progress manifest at
<workspace>/ingest_progress.json is much smaller than it used to be —
keyed by source path. Re-running skips files already ingested. To
re-ingest a changed file, DELETE FROM <table> WHERE source = '...'
first (or remove the entry from the manifest and let stable doc ids
trip the unique-key check on retry).

Why HTTP rather than bulk SQL: the same reason that has not changed —
the server may run on a different machine than this script (Docker,
Kubernetes), so we cannot assume it can read a manifest file from the
local filesystem. Per-file POST works regardless of where the server is.
