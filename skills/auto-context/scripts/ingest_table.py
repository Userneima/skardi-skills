"""Ingest documents that already live as rows in a table.

This is the second raw-material entry (see "Where the raw material comes
from" in SKILL.md): one row = one document. Two ways in:

  --db staging.db --table docs --key-column id --content-column body
      Read rows straight out of a SQLite file. The file is opened
      read-only (URI mode=ro), so pointing this at a table someone else
      owns cannot write to it, alter it, or leave journal files behind.

  --ndjson -  (or a file path)
      Read one JSON object per line: {"key": ..., "content": ...,
      "source": ...} ("source" optional). Produced by whatever client
      already talks to the datastore the rows live in — psql with
      json_build_object, mongoexport, or a five-line script. This is how
      a table in a datastore this script has no driver for still gets
      ingested with the same accounting, without this skill growing a
      driver per database.

Everything downstream is identical to ingest_corpus.py — same endpoint,
same manifest (<workspace>/ingest_progress.json), same resume / skip /
accounting semantics — because a document's origin stops mattering the
moment it is serialised into {doc_id, source, content}.

Identity: a document IS its source string. doc_id is derived from it the
same way ingest_corpus.py derives ids from relative paths, so source
strings must be unique within the run and stable across runs. By default
that is "<label>#<key>" (label defaults to the table name); pass
--source-column when rows already carry a real locator (a URL, a path) —
those make better citations. Changing the label or the source scheme
between runs re-ingests everything under new ids NEXT TO the old rows,
the same way moving a corpus root does on the folder path.

Rows are ingested as-is: no front-matter stripping, no cleanup. The
landing step (references/fetch_and_land.md) is where boilerplate gets
removed — by the time text is in a table it is what gets indexed.
