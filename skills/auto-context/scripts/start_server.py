"""Start skardi-server and wait for /health.

Three runtimes are supported. Pick the one that matches the destination
environment for the agent the RAG service will sit behind:

  --runtime local-process   (default)
      Run skardi-server directly as a host process. Prefers a release
      binary on PATH; falls back to `cargo run --release` from
      --skardi-source. Right for laptops, dev work, single-user RAG.

  --runtime docker
      Run via `docker run` against the official RAG image
      (ghcr.io/skardilabs/skardi/skardi-server-full:X.Y.Z, --features rag —
      bundles chunk() + the embedding UDFs). Right for shipping RAG to
      teammates without asking them to compile Skardi, and for keeping the
      server isolated from the host's Python / OpenSSL / libsqlite versions.

  --runtime kubernetes
      Render Deployment + Service + ConfigMap + (Secret) into
      <workspace>/k8s/ and (optionally) `kubectl apply` them. Right
      when the user's agent already runs in a cluster — collocating
      skardi-server next to the agent removes the host-network hop and
      lets multiple agent replicas share one retrieval surface.

In every mode we end the same way: poll http://<host>:<port>/health
until 200, list /pipelines, and (in the Docker / k8s cases) leave the
external port-forwarded address printed so http_ingest.py / curl can
use it. <workspace>/server.{pid,port,runtime} stash the lifecycle bits
stop_server.py needs.
