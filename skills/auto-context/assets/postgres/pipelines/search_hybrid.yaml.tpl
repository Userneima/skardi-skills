  description: >
    Hybrid search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion of pg_knn (vector) and pg_fts
    (full-text) over the same row. The query text is embedded inline
    server-side for the vector side; the FTS side takes a separate
    `text_query` so the agent can phrase each side optimally (e.g.
    concept-y vector, lexical FTS). Constant 60 is standard RRF k.

# Parameters:
#   {query}         - Natural-language query for the vector side (embedded server-side).
#   {text_query}    - Web-search syntax string for pg_fts.
#   {vector_weight} - RRF weight for the vector rank (e.g. 0.5).
#   {text_weight}   - RRF weight for the text rank   (e.g. 0.5).
#   {limit}         - Maximum number of results.
