    Hybrid search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Vector candidates from
    sqlite_knn + keyword candidates from sqlite_fts are fused by rank.
    Final JOIN reattaches canonical source + chunk_idx from documents.

# Parameters:
#   {query}          - Natural-language query (embedded for sqlite_knn)
#   {text_query}     - Keyword query for sqlite_fts
#   {vector_weight}  - RRF weight for vector results (e.g. 0.5)
#   {text_weight}    - RRF weight for text results (e.g. 0.5)
#   {limit}          - Maximum number of fused results
