"""Guard: the pre-#170 CLI story must not creep back into current instructions.

Before skardi PR #170 the CLI carried its own engine: you pointed
`SKARDICONFIG` at a directory and ran `skardi grep` / `skardi fts` locally,
with no server. None of that exists in the v0.5.0 release — its subcommands
are query / run / pipeline / job / schema / health, and it only ever talks to
a running server over HTTP. Instructions that still use the old shapes send
an agent down a path that cannot work, and the failure is confusing rather
than obvious (`command not found` on a subcommand, or a silently ignored
environment variable).

Two more traps in the same family:

  * `--branch main` installs. The skill has to be reproducible against a
    tagged release; `main` carries unreleased changes that cannot be named
    in a bug report.
  * A floating `:latest` image tag. It moves under the user, so a workspace
    that works today can break tomorrow with no version to point at.

This test only guards text an agent or user would *follow*. Prose that names
an obsolete shape in order to say it is obsolete is fine and is what the
allowlist below is for — the point is to keep the history readable without
letting it become an instruction again.
