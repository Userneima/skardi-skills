"""Guards for check_candle_dim — the hand-typed --embedding-dim.

Why this needs a test at all: a wrong dimension is invisible until ingest.
Measured 2026-09-02 on a real 111-document Chinese corpus with
bge-small-zh-v1.5 declared as 384 (its actual width is 512): setup passed
4/4, the server started, all five pipelines registered, and then 111/111
documents failed after 86 seconds with a sqlite-vec dimension mismatch.

The negative cases matter as much as the positive one. This check reads a
file it does not own, so an unfamiliar or broken config.json must degrade to
a note — turning "I could not verify" into a refusal would block models
whose config is merely shaped differently from the ones we know.

Run: python3 tests/test_embedding_dim.py
