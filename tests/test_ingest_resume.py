"""A re-POST of a document the server already holds must converge, not loop.

The manifest is flushed at most every two seconds, so an interrupted run leaves
files whose rows are committed but whose manifest entry is missing. Those files
come back as `pending` on the next run and collide on the primary key. When that
collision was reported as a failure, the manifest recorded `err:`, the run after
that saw `err:` as pending again, and the file could never leave that state
without hand-deleting rows — while the troubleshooting table promised that
"resuming after a pause loses no work".

These tests pin the three-way outcome and the manifest write that goes with it.
