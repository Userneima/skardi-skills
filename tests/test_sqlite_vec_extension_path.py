"""A loadable-extension path is a stem, and validating it as a filename fails.

`sqlite_vec.loadable_path()` returns `.../sqlite_vec/vec0`; the file on disk
is `vec0.dylib` (or `.so` / `.dll`), and SQLite's `load_extension` appends the
suffix itself. setup_context.py knew that and validated by looking for
`vec0.*` in the directory. start_server.py did not — it called
`Path(recorded).is_file()`, which is False for every correctly resolved path,
so the recorded value was never usable and the default local path refused to
start:

    ERROR: SQLITE_VEC_PATH is not set, and the path recorded at setup time
    no longer exists: .../site-packages/sqlite_vec/vec0

Measured on macOS 2026-08-26 against a real sqlite-vec install. The refusal
was unconditional — the only way past it was to export SQLITE_VEC_PATH by
hand, which then printed a bogus "that file does not exist" warning from the
same mistake in the other branch.
