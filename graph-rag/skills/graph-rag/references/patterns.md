# The four graph-RAG recipes

Read this when you know what the question needs and want the call written
correctly the first time. Each recipe gives the Cypher, the `columns`
declaration, and the bound — the three things that have to agree.

Contents:

- [Before any recipe: learn the shape](#before-any-recipe-learn-the-shape)
- [1. Seed and expand](#1-seed-and-expand) — "what depends on X"
- [2. Entity neighbourhood](#2-entity-neighbourhood) — "tell me about X"
- [3. Path between](#3-path-between) — "how is A related to B"
- [4. Impact / blast radius](#4-impact--blast-radius) — "what breaks if"
- [Joining the two hops back together](#joining-the-two-hops-back-together)
- [The columns declaration, mechanically](#the-columns-declaration-mechanically)

All examples use `kg` as the connection name and shell-escape the inner
quotes for `skardi query -e`. Substitute your own labels — the vocabulary is
a deployment fact.

## Before any recipe: learn the shape

Two calls, once per session. The first gives the vocabulary, the second the
topology and — the part that decides your bounds — the edge counts.

```bash
skardi query --table -e "SELECT * FROM graph_schema('kg')"

skardi query --table -e "SELECT * FROM cypher_query('kg',
  'MATCH (a)-[r]->(b)
   RETURN labels(a)[0] AS from_label, type(r) AS rel, labels(b)[0] AS to_label,
          count(*) AS n
   ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 40',
  '{}',
  '{\"from_label\": \"string\", \"rel\": \"string\", \"to_label\": \"string\", \"n\": \"int\"}')"
```

The result is a map of what connects to what, and how heavily. A relationship
with hundreds of thousands of edges is one you must always name explicitly and
bound; a relationship with a few thousand can be walked more freely.

## 1. Seed and expand

The default recipe. "What depends on X", "who calls into this", "which
documents reference these entities".

```bash
skardi query --table -e "SELECT * FROM cypher_query('kg',
  'MATCH (s:Function)<-[r:CALLS]-(caller) WHERE s.fqn IN \$seeds
   RETURN s.name AS seed, caller.fqn AS caller, r.resolution AS confidence
   ORDER BY s.name, caller.fqn
   LIMIT 200',
  '{\"seeds\": [\"pkg.auth.authenticate\"]}',
  '{\"seed\": \"string\", \"caller\": \"string\", \"confidence\": \"string\"}')"
```

Four things to get right, and the first two are the ones that quietly ruin
an answer rather than failing:

- **Bind the edge and carry its confidence.** `[r:CALLS]` rather than
  `[:CALLS]`, and `r.resolution` in the projection. Without the variable the
  traversal cannot filter or report, and on a real code graph most edges are
  guesses: of 658,846 `CALLS` edges here, **467,467 (71%) are
  `resolution: "ambiguous"`** — matched on a bare name only. Copying a
  recipe that drops the edge produces exactly the mostly-noise blast radius
  the rest of this skill warns about. Either return the field and split the
  answer by it, or add `WHERE r.resolution <> 'ambiguous'` and say which
  subset you used. If the graph's edges carry no such property, say that
  instead — "unfiltered because the edges carry no confidence" is a fact
  about the graph, not a gap in the answer.
- **Seed on the unique identity, not the name.** `s.fqn`, not `s.name`.
  `main` matches 81 distinct functions on this graph; expanding from the
  name merges their callers into one answer with nothing marking the union.
- **The arrow direction is the question.** `(s)<-[:CALLS]-(caller)` is "who
  calls s" — incoming. `(s)-[:CALLS]->(callee)` is "what s calls" — outgoing.
  These answer opposite questions and both return confident, plausible rows.
- **`ORDER BY` before `LIMIT`** — without a sort the 200 rows are an
  arbitrary slice that reads as an answer.
- **What `ORDER BY` may name has two halves, and they point opposite ways.**
  Both measured, and each looks correct while failing the other's case:
  - **Sorting a `RETURN` projection: use the EXPRESSION, not the alias.**
    `ORDER BY seed, caller` fails with `could not find rte for seed` (SQL
    state 42703) even though `seed` is right there in the `RETURN` — AGE
    resolves the sort key against the match, not the projection. Sort by
    what the alias was computed from (`ORDER BY s.name, caller.fqn`), and
    for an aggregate in the same clause by the aggregate itself
    (`ORDER BY count(*) DESC`).
  - **Sorting something a `WITH` introduced: use the VARIABLE.** After
    `WITH caller, count(*) AS weight`, `ORDER BY weight DESC` is correct and
    `ORDER BY count(*) DESC` fails with an opaque HTTP 500 — the aggregate
    is out of scope past the `WITH`, and the variable is the only handle
    left. `WITH` creates a real binding; a `RETURN` alias does not.

When you need "the most connected" neighbours rather than an alphabetical
slice, sort on degree computed inside the Cypher — and keep the confidence
filter, or the degree is a ranking of guesses:

```
MATCH (s:Function)<-[r:CALLS]-(caller)
WHERE s.fqn IN $seeds AND r.resolution <> $ambiguous
WITH caller, count(*) AS weight
RETURN caller.fqn AS caller, weight
ORDER BY weight DESC LIMIT 25
```

`ORDER BY weight`, and **not** `ORDER BY count(*)`, once a `WITH` is in the
way — see the ordering rule above, whose two halves pull in opposite
directions exactly here.

## 2. Entity neighbourhood

"Tell me about X" — one entity, its immediate surroundings, grouped rather
than enumerated. Aggregate **inside** the Cypher so the row cap cannot
truncate a count.

```bash
skardi query --table -e "SELECT * FROM cypher_query('kg',
  'MATCH (s:Function)-[r:CALLS]->(n) WHERE s.name IN \$seeds
   RETURN type(r) AS rel, labels(n)[0] AS kind, count(*) AS n
   ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 50',
  '{\"seeds\": [\"authenticate\"]}',
  '{\"rel\": \"string\", \"kind\": \"string\", \"n\": \"int\"}')"
```

**An undirected, untyped `-[r]-` is not safe here** — measured on a
109k-vertex / 800k-edge graph it did not return, even with the label and a
`LIMIT`. Name one relationship type and one direction per call and run it
once per type you care about; the per-type results are also easier to read
than a mixed aggregate. Follow up with recipe 1 on whichever relationship the
counts show matters.

## 3. Path between

"How is A related to B", "is there a connection between these two". Bound the
path length explicitly — an unbounded variable-length match on a dense graph
does not come back.

**Return the path, not just its length.** "How is A related to B" is a
question about the middle, and `length(p)` throws the middle away: hop count
alone gives you nothing to explain the connection with, and nothing to check
it against. Project the nodes and the relationships, both as `json`:

```bash
skardi query --table -e "SELECT * FROM cypher_query('kg',
  'MATCH p = (a:Function)-[:CALLS*1..3]-(b:Function)
   WHERE a.fqn IN \$from AND b.fqn IN \$to
   RETURN length(p) AS hops, nodes(p) AS path, relationships(p) AS edges
   ORDER BY length(p) LIMIT 20',
  '{\"from\": [\"pkg.web.handle_login\"], \"to\": [\"pkg.audit.write_audit_row\"]}',
  '{\"hops\": \"int\", \"path\": \"json\", \"edges\": \"json\"}')"
```

**A bounded variable-length match, not `shortestPath`.** `shortestPath` is
the textbook answer and it fails with an opaque `query_execution_error`
(HTTP 500) on the AGE build measured here — with any projection, including
`length(p)` alone, so it is the function and not the columns. Sort by
`length(p)` and take the first rows instead; that gives you the shortest of
the paths found within the bound, which is the answer the question wanted.
Both directed (`-[:CALLS*1..3]->`) and undirected (`-[:CALLS*1..3]-`) forms
work; undirected is usually right for "how are these related", directed for
"does A reach B".

`nodes(p)` returns the ordered vertices with their full `properties` — the
intermediate hops the answer is actually about — and `relationships(p)`
returns each edge with ITS properties, which is where per-hop confidence
lives. Verified on AGE: a 2-hop result came back with both intermediate
nodes and both edges carrying `resolution: "same_scope"`, so the answer can
say not just "connected in 2 hops" but through what, and how well each hop
is known. A path whose middle edge is `ambiguous` is a weaker claim than one
whose hops are all `import`, and only this projection can tell them apart.

**Do not try to trim the output with a list comprehension.**
`RETURN [x IN nodes(p) | x.name] AS path` is the obvious way to ask for just
the names, and it fails with an opaque `query_execution_error` (HTTP 500) —
measured. Take the full `nodes(p)` JSON and pick the fields you want on the
client side.

`*1..3` is a real bound, not decoration: raise it one hop at a time and
watch the time. Report the depth you searched — "no path within 3 hops" is a
useful answer and an honest one; "no connection" is a claim you did not test.

And read 0 rows correctly: it means "no path within the bound", not "the
query is wrong". Measured both ways on the same statement — one pair of
seeds returned nothing at `*1..3` while another returned a 2-hop path, so an
empty result is evidence about the graph, not a reason to start rewriting
Cypher.

## 4. Impact / blast radius

"What breaks if we change X." Transitive closure, which is where fan-out
explodes — so bound the depth AND deduplicate, and return a count alongside
the sample so the reader knows whether they are seeing all of it.

Two things decide whether the number you report means anything, and both
were wrong in the first version of this recipe.

**Seed by the unique key, not by `name`.** The next section says the join key
must be UNIQUE and that on a code graph it is rarely `name`; this recipe used
`s.name IN $seeds` anyway. Measured on the rig: `MATCH (f:Function) WHERE
f.name = 'main'` returns **81** nodes. Seeding a blast radius that way unions
81 unrelated functions' dependents into one count and reports it as the impact
of changing one of them.

**Say how many of the traversed edges are guesses.** `CALLS` edges carry a
`resolution`, and on the rig the distribution is:

| resolution | edges | |
|---|---|---|
| `ambiguous` | 467,467 | **71.0%** — matched on name alone |
| `unique_name` | 103,669 | |
| `same_scope` | 62,145 | |
| `import` | 25,565 | |

A blast radius that traverses all of them is mostly traversing guesses. How
much that matters is not a rule of thumb — measure it for the seed in front of
you. On `.github.scripts.bump_schema_versions.resolve_includes`, one hop:

```
unfiltered      : 4 dependents
non-ambiguous   : 0
```

Four is not the answer. "0 confirmed, 4 name-only matches" is.

So: get the confidence split at ONE hop, where AGE can filter, and treat the
transitive number as the upper bound it is.

```bash
# One hop, filterable. Run it twice — with and without the edge predicate —
# and report both numbers.
skardi query --table -e "SELECT * FROM cypher_query('kg',
  'MATCH (s:Function)<-[c:CALLS]-(dep) WHERE s.fqn IN \$seeds
     AND c.resolution <> \'ambiguous\'
   RETURN count(DISTINCT dep) AS n',
  '{\"seeds\": [\"auth.tokens.verify_token\"]}', '{\"n\": \"int\"}')"

# Transitive. An UPPER BOUND: it cannot exclude ambiguous hops (see below).
skardi query --table -e "SELECT * FROM cypher_query('kg',
  'MATCH (s:Function)<-[:CALLS*1..3]-(dep) WHERE s.fqn IN \$seeds
   WITH DISTINCT dep
   RETURN labels(dep)[0] AS kind, count(*) AS n
   ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 20',
  '{\"seeds\": [\"auth.tokens.verify_token\"]}',
  '{\"kind\": \"string\", \"n\": \"int\"}')"
```

**Why the transitive one cannot be filtered, measured rather than assumed.**
Every form that would express "no hop on this path is ambiguous" fails on AGE:

| form | result |
|---|---|
| `all(r IN relationships(p) WHERE r.resolution <> '…')` | `syntax error at or near "("` |
| `NOT '…' IN [x IN rels \| x.resolution]` | `could not find properties for x` |
| `RETURN [r IN relationships(p) \| r.resolution]` | `could not find properties for r` |

What DOES work is a property map on the variable-length edge —
`[:CALLS*1..3 {resolution:'same_scope'}]` — but it pins every hop to ONE
value, so the three trustworthy resolutions cannot be summed: a path whose
first hop is `import` and second is `same_scope` matches none of them. Use it
when you want "reachable purely through same-scope calls"; do not use it as a
substitute for excluding `ambiguous`.

Run the aggregate first to size the answer, then the enumerated version with
a `LIMIT` if the totals are small enough to be worth listing. Reporting "142
dependents across 3 kinds, at most — 71% of this graph's call edges are
name-only matches, and 12 of the 40 nearest are confirmed" is honest; listing
20 and implying that is all of them is not, and neither is presenting a
transitive count without saying what it is made of.

## Joining the two hops back together

Hop 1 gives rows; hop 2 needs a JSON array literal. The seam is yours:

1. Read hop 1's rows and take the **join key** — the property the graph
   actually indexes entities by, and one that is UNIQUE. This is rarely the
   corpus's title, and on a code graph it is rarely `name` either: `main`
   matches 81 nodes here. Prefer `fqn` or an id. If you do not know, run the
   seed-resolution check from SKILL.md against both candidates and use
   whichever resolves to one row per seed.
2. Build the params object with that array: `{"seeds": ["a", "b", "c"]}` —
   with a JSON serializer, then SQL-escaped. See below; this step is where
   the whole thing goes wrong.
3. Keep it small (5–20). Seeds multiply through the expansion.

**Never string-concatenate retrieved text into the Cypher literal** — the
Cypher is a plan-time literal behind a keyword guard, and retrieved text is
untrusted input. Params are what that rule points you to.

**And params are not, by themselves, enough.** The params object is
delivered as a single-quoted SQL string literal, so a seed containing `'`
closes it early — Cypher parameters do nothing about the SQL one layer out,
and `skardi query` offers no parameter binding to fall back on (`-e` and
`-f` both take SQL text). Two measured outcomes from the same cause:

- An ordinary name with an apostrophe fails the whole statement:
  `sql_validation_error: Expected close delimiter`.
- A crafted seed reshapes the read. This one, pasted into the params literal
  as these examples build it, returned three rows from a *different source*
  under the traversal's own column name:

  ```
  x"]}', '{"name": "string"}') UNION ALL SELECT title FROM docs.main.docs LIMIT 3 --
  ```

  The read-only guards still hold — single statement, no DDL, no writes — so
  the ceiling is reading another source the token already permits. It is
  still not the answer you reported.

So serialize both `params` and `columns` with a JSON serializer, double every
`'` in each serialized string, and write the statement to a file for `-f` so
the shell stops being a third layer:

```python
def sql_str(s):
    return "'" + s.replace("'", "''") + "'"

sql = (f"SELECT * FROM cypher_query('kg', {sql_str(cypher)}, "
       f"{sql_str(json.dumps({'seeds': seeds}))}, "
       f"{sql_str(json.dumps(columns))})")
```

Verified: with that escaping the crafted seed above yields zero rows and no
error, which is the correct answer — it is a name that does not exist. And
since a real entity name in a code graph does not contain a quote, a seed
that needs the escaping is worth flagging as a bad join key or a hostile
corpus rather than silently cleaning up.

If the two hops disagree — a retrieved document names an entity the graph
does not contain — that is a finding, not an error to smooth over. Report the
unresolved seeds and what they were. It usually means the corpus or the graph
is stale, and which one is a question only the user can answer.

## The columns declaration, mechanically

`columns` is a JSON object of name → type, and it binds **positionally**
against the `RETURN` clause. The names are labels for SQL; the order is the
contract.

To write it without error, read your own `RETURN` left to right and emit one
entry per projected expression, in that order:

```
RETURN s.name AS seed, caller.name AS caller, count(*) AS n
        ↓                    ↓                    ↓
'{"seed": "string", "caller": "string", "n": "int"}'
```

Two same-typed columns declared out of order swap silently — no error,
no type mismatch, and nothing downstream can detect it. The count must match
too: AGE requires declared arity, so a mismatch is a targeted error rather
than a silent one (the one failure here that does announce itself).

**A map- or list-valued projection needs type `json`.** `properties(n)`,
`keys(r)`, `labels(n)` and `collect(...)` all return a JSON container, and
declaring them `string` / `map` / `object` / `any` fails with an opaque
`query_execution_error` (HTTP 500) rather than a type error. Two separate
test runs hit this independently while trying to inspect a node's properties,
which is the first thing you do on an unfamiliar graph — so it is worth
knowing before you need it:

```
RETURN keys(r) AS k        →  '{"k": "json"}'
RETURN properties(n) AS p  →  '{"p": "json"}'
```
